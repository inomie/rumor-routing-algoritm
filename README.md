# rumor-routing-algoritm

A network consisting of a number of wireless sensor nodes that are to be simulated with a relatively short range on the radio transmission. The nodes detect unique events, and you should then be able to make requests to any node in the network and this request should then be forwarded in the network to the node that detected the event. For the communication between the nodes, the rumor-routing algorithm is being used.
